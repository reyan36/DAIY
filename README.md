## Project Overview

DAIY is an AI-powered Socratic learning platform that helps you build genuine understanding by guiding you to answers instead of giving them to you. It asks questions, challenges assumptions, and celebrates your breakthroughs, turning every conversation into a learning experience.

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Socratic AI Chat** | Never gives direct answers. It asks questions, challenges your assumptions, and guides your thinking step by step. |
| **Breakthrough Detection** | Recognizes and celebrates genuine "Aha!" moments during your learning conversations. |
| **Reasoning Timeline** | Visualizes your thought process as a timeline from Question to Assumption to Challenge to Insight. |
| **Multi-Model Support** | Use free models like Groq or bring your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. |
| **Secure Architecture** | API keys are encrypted and stored securely. All sensitive operations are handled server-side. |
